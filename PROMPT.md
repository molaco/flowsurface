@IMPL.md @tasks_overview.yaml

i want you for task id={1,2,3,4,5,6}

to generate batches batch_1 = {1,2,3}, batch_2 = {4,5,6}

for each batch i want you to spawn a new general agent for each task id and run them in parallel.

tell each generalized agent to run "uv run ./SCRIPTS/get_task.py {task_id}" to get the task from tasks.yaml (because tasks.yaml is very big file)

each agent needs to implent the particular task at hand.

when they finish analyze the work done and see if it matches IMPL.md and tasks_overview.yaml

report to me and do a summary.
