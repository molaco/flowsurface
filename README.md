    -   **Candlestick:** Traditional kline chart supporting both time-based and custom tick-based intervals.
    -   **Footprint:** Price-grouped and interval-aggregated views for trades on top of candlestick chart; supports different clustering methods. Includes configurable imbalance and naked-POC studies.
    -   **Time & Sales:** Scrollable list of live trades.
    -   **DOM (Depth of Market) / Ladder:** A real-time, interactive panel that displays current L2 orderbook alongside recent trade volumes on grouped price levels.
-   Real-time sound effects driven by trade streams
-   Pane linking and grouping for quickly switching tickers across multiple panes
-   Customizable and persistent layouts, themes, panel and chart settings

#### Historical Trades on Footprint Charts

-   By default, they capture and plot live trades in real time via WebSocket.
-   For Binance tickers, you can optionally backfill the visible time range by enabling trade fetching in the settings:
    -   [data.binance.vision](https://data.binance.vision/): Fast daily bulk downloads (no intraday).
    -   REST API (e.g., `/fapi/v1/aggTrades`): Slower, paginated intraday fetching (subject to rate limits).
    -   The Binance connector can use either or both methods to retrieve historical data as needed.
-   Trade fetching for Bybit/Hyperliquid is not supported, as both lack a suitable REST API. OKX is WIP.
